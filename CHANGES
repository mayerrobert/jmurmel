Changes in JMurmel-1.4.6 relative to JMurmel-1.4.5

Changes in JMurmel-1.4.5 relative to JMurmel-1.4.4
released: 2023-12-31

   so that e.g.
     jmurmel --repl --eval (load \"mlib\")
   will work as expected
 * added the primitives lisp-implementation-type and lisp-implementation-version

Changes in JMurmel-1.2.2 relative to JMurmel-1.2.1
released: 2022-05-20

   or expanding the wrong version of a macro that is defined more than once.


Changes in JMurmel-1.2.1 relative to JMurmel-1.2
released: 2022-05-07

 * changed the interpreter to expand macros only once

 * added --final-result and --no-final-result

 * fixed the compiler to tailcall-optimize let/let* dynamic


Changes in JMurmel-1.2 relative to JMurmel-1.1
released: 2022-04-20

   changed return value to nil (was: actually slept time in internal-time-units-per-second)
 * changed/ fixed "apply" from a special operator to a function, "apply" no longer is a reserved word,
   "apply" now accepts symbols as the first argument as well

 * changed macroexpand-1 to return multiple values as one would expect
 * changed setq to create undefined variables on the fly in interpreted mode

   (was: 1 or 2 arguments, anything more was silently ignored)

 * added the function "jproxy" to implement Java interfaces with Murmel code
 * added values, multiple-value-call and multiple-value-bind
 * added primitive functions assq, list*
 * added an optional parameter print-escape-p for primitive functions write, writeln, lnwrite
 * added special operator "(declaim (optimize..."
 * added limited support for "macroexpand-1" in compiled code (quoted forms only)
 * errormessages contain the filename and linenumber (was: only linenumber)
 * added more complete support for "let dynamic" and "let* dynamic"
   (before 1.2 only "let* dynamic" in interpreted code was supported)

   with-accumulator, summing, collecting, reverse-collecting, plist-keys, plist-values

 * some functions are "opencoded" (i.e. trampolines and/ or argcount checks are omitted,
   regular Java code is emitted instead)
 * fixed compiler primitive "list" to return a mutable list
 * fixed compiled "let*"
 * fixed "append" for compiled code
 * fixed using rplaca on varargs list
 * fixed/ cleaned up feature-flags
 * fixed search directory for load and require
