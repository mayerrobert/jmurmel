;;;; Functions and macros to submit events to Java Flight Recorder
;;;;
;;;; Run this file with
;;;;
;;;;     java -XX:StartFlightRecording:settings=profile,filename=jm.jfr -jar jmurmel.jar jfr.lisp
;;;;
;;;; and then open the file jm.jfr in Java Management Console (see https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/8/).
;;;; Select "Event Browser", the category "JMurmel" will contain the subcategories "Events" and "Function calls"
;;;; where submitted events should be found.
;;;; Events need to be started and ended. This will record start and end time and additional info.
